# Starting point for DESN 3035 Exercise 3

> Glad to have you with us!

> Take a look at the `content.tsx` file where we have a simple list of countries. Do you think you can set up and connect an external database so that this list is not hard coded? I hear Supabase (https://supabase.com/) is perfect for this type of work.

> When you are done, please submit a PR (pull request) back to this repo and I can review it.
